# Google AI Round-Trip History

## Purpose

This file records the historical Google AI mutation tests that were run against the Textify/Blockify IR workflow.

Each case includes:

- the shared starting IR used for the test set
- the exact prompt given to the model
- a normalized description of the intended mutation
- the observed result recorded from historical Blockify screenshots

## Important Notes

### 1. Starting IR Is Canonicalized

The shared starting IR below is a canonicalized reconstruction of the historical test setup.

It preserves the important structural invariants from the original test run:

- `[procedure]` root
- `proccode:"TEST BLOCK A"`
- top-level `control_repeat`
- nested `control_if`
- nested `data_changevariableby`
- `operator_equals` condition using `motion_xposition` and `50`
- `VARIABLE:"x"`
- `VALUE:[literal:number:1]`

Exact historical IDs may differ.

### 2. Historical Renderer Limits

These screenshots were taken before full Blockify visual support existed for several opcodes.

As a result, successful historical results may still display placeholders like:

- `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`
- `[unsupported opcode: operator_equals]`

That does **not** mean the mutation failed.

The key historical signal is that the screenshots show:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- successful visual survival through Blockify

### 3. Mutation Section

The `Mutation` section below is a normalized structural summary of what Google was asked to produce.

It should not be treated as a verbatim copy of Google’s returned IR.

## Shared Starting IR

            }
            stacks:{
              SUBSTACK:[stack:
                [opcode:data_changevariableby
                  id:"change1"
                  fields:{
                    VARIABLE:"x"
                  }
                  inputs:{
                    VALUE:[literal:number:1]
                  }
                  stacks:{}
                ]
              ]
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
]
```

## Test 1

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Move the existing control_if block inside the repeat block’s SUBSTACK.
```

### Mutation

- result should center on a top-level `control_repeat`
- the `control_if` should live under that repeat’s `SUBSTACK`
- the nested variable-change command should remain preserved

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visual output showed only a top-level `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`

Interpretation:

- the mutation survived Blockify
- the repeat wrapper remained valid
- the historical renderer did not expose the nested internal structure clearly in this screenshot because `control_repeat` was not yet visually supported

## Test 2

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Add a second control_if block directly below the existing control_repeat block in the top-level stack.
```

### Mutation

- keep the existing top-level repeat
- add another `control_if` below it
- preserve the same condition/value structures where reused

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visible render showed:
  - one `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`
  - one `if` block containing `change x by 1`

Interpretation:

- the result survived Blockify
- at least one `if` branch remained valid after the edit
- the repeat stayed structurally present at the top level

## Test 3

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Replace the top-level stack with three control blocks in this exact order:

1. control_if with one data_changevariableby command inside
2. control_if with an empty SUBSTACK
3. control_repeat with an empty SUBSTACK

For the non-empty if block, use the same CONDITION structure, VARIABLE, and VALUE found in the provided IR.
```

### Mutation

- top-level order:
  - `control_if` with one `data_changevariableby`
  - `control_if` with empty `SUBSTACK`
  - `control_repeat` with empty `SUBSTACK`

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visible render showed:
  - `if` with `change x by 1`
  - `if` with `[empty stack]`
  - `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`

Interpretation:

- the requested order survived
- the empty-stack case survived
- Blockify accepted the mutation structurally

## Test 4

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Create this exact top-level order:

1. empty control_repeat block
2. one data_changevariableby command
3. one control_if block containing one data_changevariableby command
4. one data_changevariableby command

All variable-change commands must use the same VARIABLE and VALUE as the original command.
The control_if block must use the same CONDITION structure as the original inner if block.
```

### Mutation

- top-level order:
  - empty `control_repeat`
  - `data_changevariableby`
  - `control_if` containing `data_changevariableby`
  - `data_changevariableby`

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visible render showed:
  - `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`
  - `change x by 1`
  - `if` containing `change x by 1`
  - `change x by 1`

Interpretation:

- the requested top-level order survived
- repeated variable-change commands remained valid
- the mixed empty/non-empty structure survived

## Test 5

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Modify the top-level stack so it contains:

1. one control_if block
   - inside its SUBSTACK:
     - first, one data_changevariableby command
     - second, one control_repeat block containing one data_changevariableby command
2. immediately after the if block, add one data_changevariableby command at the parent stack level

Use the same CONDITION structure, VARIABLE, and VALUE found in the provided IR.
```

### Mutation

- top-level:
  - `control_if`
  - `data_changevariableby`
- inside the `if`:
  - one direct `data_changevariableby`
  - one nested `control_repeat` containing another `data_changevariableby`

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visible render showed:
  - `if` containing `change x by 1`
  - a nested `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]` inside the `if`
  - one additional top-level `change x by 1` below the `if`

Interpretation:

- the parent-level promotion/addition survived
- nested repeat-within-if survived
- the shape matched the requested mixed nesting

## Test 6

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Replace the top-level stack with:

1. control_if with an empty SUBSTACK
2. control_repeat with an empty SUBSTACK

Keep the CONDITION valid for the if block by using the same CONDITION structure found in the provided IR.
```

### Mutation

- top-level order:
  - empty `control_if`
  - empty `control_repeat`

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visible render showed:
  - `if` with `[empty stack]`
  - `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`

Interpretation:

- both empty-control cases survived
- the empty `if` remained valid
- the empty repeat remained structurally present

## Test 7

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Modify only the inside of the existing inner control_if block:

Wrap the data_changevariableby command inside a control_repeat block.

The repeat block should be the only child of that control_if block's SUBSTACK.
The data_changevariableby command should be inside the repeat block’s SUBSTACK.

Do not change the existing top-level control_repeat block.
Do not change the CONDITION, VARIABLE, or VALUE.
```

### Mutation

- keep the outer repeat in place
- keep the inner `if` in place
- replace the inner `if` substack contents with:
  - one `control_repeat`
    - containing one `data_changevariableby`

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visual output showed only a top-level `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`

Interpretation:

- the mutation survived Blockify
- the outer repeat remained valid
- the inner nesting was not clearly visible in the fallback render because `control_repeat` was unsupported

## Test 8

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Replace the top-level stack with three control blocks in this exact order:

1. control_if with one data_changevariableby command inside
2. control_repeat with one data_changevariableby command inside
3. control_if with an empty SUBSTACK

All variable-change commands must use the same VARIABLE and VALUE.
All control_if blocks must use the same CONDITION structure found in the provided IR.
```

### Mutation

- top-level order:
  - `control_if` with one `data_changevariableby`
  - `control_repeat` with one `data_changevariableby`
  - `control_if` with empty `SUBSTACK`

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visible render showed:
  - `if` containing `change x by 1`
  - `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`
  - `if` with `[empty stack]`

Interpretation:

- the requested control-block order survived
- both non-empty and empty control mouths survived

## Test 9

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Transform the IR so the only top-level block is a control_repeat block.

Inside that repeat:
- place a control_if
- inside that if, place another control_repeat
- inside that repeat, place another control_if
- inside that final if, place one data_changevariableby command

Use the same CONDITION structure for all control_if blocks.
Use the same VARIABLE and VALUE for the data_changevariableby command.
```

### Mutation

- only one top-level `control_repeat`
- nested inside:
  - `control_if`
    - `control_repeat`
      - `control_if`
        - `data_changevariableby`

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visual output showed only a top-level `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`

Interpretation:

- the deep nesting survived structurally
- the historical renderer collapsed the visible output because the top-level repeat remained unsupported at that point in development

## Test 10

### Starting IR

Use the shared starting IR above.

### Prompt

```text
Perform all of the following:

- move the data_changevariableby command out of the inner control_if block to the top level
- place it above everything
- add a new control_if block below it containing one data_changevariableby command
- add an empty control_repeat block at the bottom

All data_changevariableby commands must use the same VARIABLE and VALUE.
All control_if blocks must use the same CONDITION structure found in the provided IR.
```

### Mutation

- top-level order:
  - `data_changevariableby`
  - existing or remaining control structure
  - new `control_if` containing one `data_changevariableby`
  - empty `control_repeat` at the bottom

### Results

Observed historical screenshot behavior:

- `ERROR: [none]`
- visible render showed:
  - `change x by 1`
  - `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`
  - `if` containing `change x by 1`
  - `[unsupported opcode: control_repeat]`

Interpretation:

- the promoted top-level change survived
- the new `if` survived
- the added empty repeat survived
- the overall structure remained valid through Blockify

## Historical Takeaway

These Google AI tests matter because they were not limited to simple renames or scalar edits.

They included:

- reordering
- empty substacks
- stack promotion/demotion
- nested control restructuring
- repeated reuse of the same condition/value structure

The historically important signal is:

- Google could produce nontrivial structural mutations
- Blockify accepted them without error in these recorded cases
- even when historical visual coverage was incomplete, the resulting IR still survived the round-trip validation/render path
